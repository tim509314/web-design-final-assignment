      <h1>STORM POINT MAP UPDATE</h1>
      <p>Storm Point is a map that is loved by our competitive community for its more predictable pacing and high loot quality. However, some of the elements of Storm Point that make it a great competitive map can also make it more difficult to quickly find action during casual play.</p>
      <p>This brings us to the team's primary goal for this update, which is to improve the fun factor without sacrificing competitive integrity. To do this, we’ve taken the following actions:
      <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Add attractive, central POIs for players searching for combat. Wattson’s Pylon and CETO Station provide central hot drops for players looking to fight early.</li>
        <li>Reduce overall map size to improve mid-game pacing. Significant map size reductions to both the southern coastline and northern mountainous areas make these zones more attractive for early combat and reduce the overall distance between squads.</li>
        <li>Reduce friction of central rotations. With CETO Station replacing Prowler Island and a reworked Prowler-less Forbidden Zone, rotations through the center of map have never been smoother.</li>
      </ol>

      <h1>NEW POI: DEVASTATED COAST</h1><img src="image/devastated-coast.jpg">
      <p>At Devastated Coast, players will be able to witness the hardest hit areas of the storm and battle within the ruined remains of Fish Farms.</p>
      <p>ECHO has built a protective wall to reinforce the central river from future flooding, creating a new structure that defines the ridgeline. A building suspended by the nearby crane provides a powerful position for squads fighting in the area.</p>
